# Schedular

* ## Introduction

    * > Scheduling the processes by the **operating system** is one of the most  important jobs of the **OS**. We will apply some scheduling algorithm in this project, like **SRTN** algorithm, **RoundRobin** algorithm, **HPF** algorithm.

    *   >**Note**: This code is valid only on linux machines

* ## Algorithms    

    * **SRTN** algorithm:  
        >  This algorithm depends on choosing the shortest remaining time process to be executed, it depends on the **priority queue** datastructure. and it is the **preemptive** version of **SJF** (shortest job first) algorithm.

    * Non preemptive **HPF** algorithm:
         >  This algorithm's criteria depends on choosing the highest priority process, each process has a number represents its priority, **the lowest** number represnts **the highest priority** process

    * **Round Robin** algorithm:
        > This algorithm's criteria is to give each process a **time slot** for running and then, return it back to the **ready queue** and run the next process, and so on.

* ## How to run the scheduler
    *   > open two terminals and run the following commands in the first terminal
        * ```bash
            cd code/process/
        * ```bash
            gcc process_generator.c -o PG && ./PG  
    * > then run the following to the second one
        * ```bash
            cd code/process/
        * ```bash
            gcc scheduler.c -o SC -lm && ./SC 
---
* ## Scheduler Flow
    *   > **Firstly**, the input text file **processes.txt** is read and save the processes data in the **process_generator**

    * > Each **clock cycle** generated by the program **clk.c**, we check if there is a process should be **forked** or not!

    * > After generating the process, it is listed in the queue of the chosen **algorithm**

    * > When the process is ready to start, we  check first the memory size and depending on that we decide to run the process or wait untill any bulk of memory is **freed**.

    * > when the process finish, we save all its information, **arrival** time, **finish time**, **waiting time**, **burst time**, **Turnaround** time, etc.

* ## Output files

    * > **scheduler.log** contains the following information for each process
        * > **arrival time**

        * > **total time**
        * > **Turnaround time(TA)** 
        * > **Waited turnaround time(WTA)**
    * > **scheduler.pref** contains the following information 
        * > **CPU utilization**
        * > **AVG WTA**
        * > **Avg Waiting**
        * > **Std WTA**
   * > **memory.log** contains the following information 
        * > **process id**
